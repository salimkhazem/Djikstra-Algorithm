# Djikstra Algorithm


Dijkstra’s algorithm can be used to determine the shortest path from one node in a graph to every other node within the same graph data structure, provided that the nodes are reachable from the starting node.

This algorithm will continue to run until all of the reachable vertices in a graph have been visited, which means that we could run Dijkstra’s algorithm, find the shortest path between any two reachable nodes, and then save the results somewhere. Once we run Dijkstra’s algorithm just once, we can look up our results from our algorithm again and again — without having to actually run the algorithm itself! The only time we’d ever need to re-run Dijkstra’s algorithm is if something about our graph data structure changed, in which case we’d end up re-running the algorithm to ensure that we still have the most up-to-date 
shortest paths for our particular data structure.

For better or for worse, Dijkstra’s algorithm is one of the most well-known methods of graph traversal in the world of computer science. 

The bad news is that sometimes it can feel intimidating to try to understand how it works, 

since there are so many references to it. The good news is that there are plenty of resources out there — you just need to know which ones to start with!
